I wanted to develop a python class which will follow all the standard coding standards like, logging, error handling, exception handling, documentation. This class should prepare a query using MySQL and Microsoft SQL database based on given user input. IT should use either Open AI API and/or DeepSea API and/or qwen-ai. The generated query should be compatible to run in MySQL or Microsoft SQL. 

It should able use MySQL and Microsoft SQL, so write both methods and use both connection strings.

It should be cost effective, should use less tokens, should not send the full schema every time. 

You also need write code for testing the developed class. You can decide to write single class OR multiple classes based on functionality. Define class name appropriately. The purpose of the class(es) is to generate either MySQL query or Microsoft SQL query and run this query in DB get the Results in Json format.


the user wants me to expand on the existing SQL query generation class by adding several optimizations and support for more AI APIs. Let me start by reviewing the original code and the new requirements.

The user now wants to optimize costs and performance with specific features: concise schema context, query caching, rate limiting, validation checks, query optimization, and support for DeepSea and Qwen AI. Plus, they want the code organized into separate classes for better management.

To optimize costs and performance:
Use concise schema context information
Implement query caching for repeated requests
Add rate limiting for AI API calls
Implement validation checks before executing generated queries
Add query optimization layer before execution


can you also implement the following additional requirements
Add query explanation layer
Implement cost tracking per API call
Add query execution timeouts
Implement database connection pooling
Add schema version management
Implement query complexity analysis

Also Track number of Tokens utilized for each AI API call. The final result should get the following in JSON format
User Request:
Database Used:
AI API used:
Generated Query:
Result dataset:
Input Token Count:
Response Token Count:
Summary


add error codes for easy tracking.




The class should probably handle connecting to both databases, generating the SQL query using an AI service, executing the query, and returning results. Let's break it down.

1. **Database Connections**: The class needs methods to connect to MySQL and SQL Server. Connection strings will be provided by the user. Using pyodbc for both might be a good idea since it supports both databases. I'll need separate methods for connecting, maybe `connect_mysql` and `connect_sqlserver`.

2. **AI Integration**: The class should use an AI API to generate the SQL query. The user mentioned OpenAI, DeepSea, or Qwen-AI. Since the user wants cost-effectiveness, the AI prompt should be efficient. The challenge is to generate the right query without sending the entire schema every time. Maybe the user can provide a schema summary or relevant table structures beforehand, or the class can cache schema info. But the user says not to send the full schema each time, so perhaps the method requires the user to provide a brief schema context when calling the AI.

3. **Query Generation**: The AI method needs to take the user's input (natural language query) and generate the appropriate SQL. The method should specify whether it's for MySQL or SQL Server since their syntax can differ. So, the generate_query method would need parameters for the user input, the database type, and maybe a schema context.

4. **Execution and Results**: After generating the query, the class should execute it on the correct database and return the results as JSON. So, execute_query method that takes the query and db type, uses the right connection, fetches results, and converts to JSON.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Use Python's logging module to log activities and errors. Wrap database operations in try-except blocks to catch exceptions like connection errors, query errors, etc. Also, handle API errors when using the AI services.

6. **Cost Efficiency**: To minimize tokens, the schema context provided to the AI should be concise. Maybe the user is expected to pass only relevant table structures or a summary. The class can't cache the schema unless it's provided, so the schema context is a parameter the user must manage.

7. **Testing**: Write test cases using unittest or pytest. Mock the database connections and API calls to avoid real connections during testing. Check if queries are generated correctly and if execution handles errors properly.


So the class should be flexible to allow different providers(OpenAI and/or DeepSea and/or qwen-ai). Maybe create a base class or a helper function for AI queries, allowing different providers to be plugged in. But to keep it simple, maybe start with OpenAI and make it extendable.

In the generate_query method, construct a system message that tells the AI to act as a SQL expert for the specific database, then a user message with the natural language query and schema context. The response is the generated SQL.


Potential issues: Different SQL dialects. For example, MySQL uses backticks, SQL Server uses brackets. The AI needs to know which one to generate. Also, handling LIMIT vs TOP for limiting results. The schema context needs to inform the AI about table and column names.

Putting it all together:

- Class `AIDatabaseQuery` with __init__ that takes connection strings and API keys.

- Methods to connect/disconnect for each DB.

- generate_query(user_input, db_type, schema_context) that uses AI to create the SQL.

- execute_query(query, db_type) that runs the query on the specified DB and returns JSON.

- Logging setup in __init__.

- Handle exceptions in each method, log them, and raise appropriate exceptions.

for testing, maybe use unittest.mock to mock pyodbc connections and OpenAI's API client.
