1. **Concise schema context**: The user mentioned not sending the full schema every time. So perhaps a SchemaManager class that tracks which tables/columns are relevant based on user input. Use NLP to extract entities from the query and include only related schema parts. But how to implement that simply? Maybe a dictionary of table schemas and a method to filter based on keywords in the user input.

2. **Query caching**: Cache generated queries to avoid hitting the AI API for the same input. A CacheManager class using something like LRU cache, maybe with a TTL. The key would be a hash of the user input, db_type, and schema context. Store the generated query and reuse if the same request comes in.

3. **Rate limiting**: For AI API calls, need to track the number of requests per time window. A RateLimiter class that uses a decorator to check if the limit is exceeded. Could use a token bucket algorithm or simple counter with timestamps.

4. **Validation checks**: Before executing a generated query, check for dangerous patterns like DROP, DELETE without WHERE, etc. A QueryValidator class with a list of prohibited patterns or syntax checks. Also, verify that the query is syntactically correct for the target database. Maybe use regex initially, but for robustness, a linter or EXPLAIN plan if possible.

5. **Query optimization**: Add a layer to optimize the generated query. This could involve removing redundant clauses, ensuring index usage, or simplifying joins. However, implementing a full optimizer is complex. Maybe integrate with existing tools like sqlparse for formatting and basic optimizations, or use database-specific EXPLAIN to check for efficiency.

6. **Support DeepSea and Qwen APIs**: Each AI client needs to handle their specific API calls and responses. The original code only had OpenAI. So creating separate clients that implement a common interface (generate_query method) would allow easy swapping. Need to adjust the prompt handling and response parsing for each provider.

Also, the user wants all classes separated for easier management. So the main class would compose these helper classes: AIClient, SchemaManager, CacheManager, RateLimiter, QueryValidator, QueryOptimizer.


the flow would be:

1. User provides input and db_type.

2. SchemaManager gets concise schema context based on input.

3. Check CacheManager for existing query.

4. If cached, return it; else, proceed to AI generation with rate limiting.

5. Generate query via the appropriate AIClient.

6. Validate and optimize the query.

7. Execute and return results, storing in cache if successful.
